# Evolved-Intelligence
Open archive of evolutionary forecasting and structural intelligence # L7A — Evolved Generalizing Models  
### by Christopher P. Wendling  

**Mission:**  
To share the principles and discoveries behind evolved generalizing intelligence — systems that learn to survive change rather than fit the past.  
L7A is an example of such a system, developed originally to forecast the S&P 500 index without retraining or curve-fitting, and later recognized as a broader framework for intelligence itself.  

**Purpose:**  
This repository is a gift to the world — an open archive of concepts, diagrams, and texts documenting the evolution of frequentist-Bayesian hybrid architectures, time-invariant inference, and the philosophy of evolved structure.  
It is not commercial IP. It is knowledge meant to endure.

### 🌱 Guiding Thought  

> “Evolution is what you need.”  
>  
> Intelligence is not the ability to minimize a loss on yesterday’s data.  
> Intelligence is the ability to survive tomorrow’s data.
