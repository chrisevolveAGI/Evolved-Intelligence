# Code — Evolved Intelligence Reference Implementation
### A Modular Codebase for L7A, L8A, and Future Evolved-AGI Systems

This directory contains the reference implementation components for the L7A architecture and its extensions.  
The goal is to provide a clean, modular, and extensible code structure that:

- demonstrates the core mechanics of L7A,
- illustrates how evolutionary loops work,
- supports map-surface construction,
- provides example bin structures,
- and acts as a foundation for future self-evolving AGI systems.
