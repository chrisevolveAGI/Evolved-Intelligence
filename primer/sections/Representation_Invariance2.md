# Representation Invariance — Why True Intelligence Cannot Depend on Encoding

## Overview
Machine learning models depend heavily on representation:
- tokenization
- embedding geometry
- normalization scales
- feature ordering
- data formatting
- numerical ranges
- preprocessing conventions

Change the representation → the model collapses.

But real intelligence cannot depend on fragile encodings.

True intelligence is **representation-invariant**.

This is the twenty-seventh pillar of evolved generalization.

## The Core Insight
> **If the representation changes and the model breaks, the model did not understand anything.**

Representation dependence is structural brittleness.

Real systems — brains, evolved organisms, L7A-type architectures —  
are robust to encoding changes because they extract invariants.

## Why ML Is Representation-Dependent

### 1. Tokenization dependence
LLMs rely on a fixed mapping from text → tokens → embeddings.  
Change the tokenization → the meaning shifts → the model breaks.

### 2. Embedding geometry dependence
Embeddings encode relationships as high-dimensional distances.  
If the geometry changes even slightly → everything collapses.

### 3. Normalization dependence
Neural nets require:
- specific mean/variance  
- specific scaling  
- specific ordering  

Change these → activations explode or vanish.

### 4. Training-set encoding bias
Models inherit every artifact of how the data was structured.

Machine learning does not understand meaning.  
It understands representation.

## Why Evolution Naturally Produces Representation Invariance
Evolution does not optimize weights.  
Evolution optimizes **structure that survives**.

Representations may change:
- normalization  
- bin partitioning  
- scale  
- range  
- alignment  
- projection  
- resolution  

But truth-like structure survives.

### How L7A Achieves This
1. **Multiple normalizations per trace**  
   Evolution tests each candidate against different representations.

2. **Heat death of representation-specific artifacts**  
   If a pattern depends on one representation, drift kills it immediately.

3. **Bin smoothing**  
   Sparse or unstable bins collapse toward neutrality.

4. **Population diversity**  
   Different individuals evolve different structural encodings.  
   Representation-invariant structure converges across them.

5. **Death of brittle surfaces**  
   If a candidate surface only works under one encoding → it dies.

Representation dependence cannot survive evolutionary pressure.

## Representation-Invariant Signals in Markets
Financial structure that survives:
- different normalizations  
- different time scales  
- different volatility regimes  
- different calibrations  
- different beta environments  

is real.

Structure that vanishes when encoding changes  
is not structure — it is artifact.

L7A distinguishes these automatically.

## Biological Intelligence and Representation Invariance
The brain:
- recognizes objects under different lighting  
- identifies patterns across scales  
- perceives meaning regardless of sensory noise  
- maps multiple sensory modalities into unified concepts  
- extracts invariants from dynamics  

All of this is representation-invariant reasoning.

Evolution built this robustness over millions of years.

## Why AGI Must Be Representation-Invariant
An AGI must:
- generalize across encodings  
- operate under drift  
- detect invariant structure  
- ignore formatting  
- survive normalization changes  
- learn from multiple modalities  
- maintain truth across transformations  

These are requirements of intelligence.

Representation dependence is the opposite of intelligence.

---

## Summary
Representation changes destroy ML systems because:
- their geometry is fragile  
- their “understanding” is encoding-dependent  
- they memorize correlations, not structure  

Evolution-based systems thrive because:
- survival kills representation-specific artifacts  
- invariants emerge naturally  
- population pressure purifies structure  
- calibration persists across transformations  

This is the twenty-seventh pillar of evolved generalization  
and a foundational requirement for any viable AGI architecture.
