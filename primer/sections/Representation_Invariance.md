# Representation Invariance — Structure Should Not Depend on Encoding

## Overview
If a structure is real, it must survive:
- different encodings  
- different normalizations  
- different coordinate transforms  
- different feature sets  
- different representational choices  

Noise depends on representation.  
Truth does not.

Representation invariance is the twelfth pillar of evolved generalization.

It is one of the clearest differences between:
- machine learning (representation-dependent)  
- evolved intelligence (representation-invariant)

## The Core Insight
A predictive structure should be the same regardless of:
- scaling  
- shifting  
- normalization  
- resolution  
- window length  
- encoding choice  
- coordinate convention  

If the structure vanishes when representation changes, then:
- it is not stable  
- it is not invariant  
- it is not part of reality  

Evolution preserves only representationally stable structure.

## Why Machine Learning Depends on Representation
ML models are brittle because:
- embeddings encode assumptions  
- input normalization alters learned geometry  
- feature scaling changes internal manifolds  
- coordinate transforms break learned weights  
- time-window choices determine all behavior  
- sampling changes destroy generalization  

ML models are *representation prisoners*.

They learn *the encoding*, not *the structure*.

This is why:
- LSTMs break when time windows shift  
- Transformers hallucinate when tokenization drifts  
- CNNs fail when pixel normalization changes  
- tabular ML fails when distributions shift  

ML systems are not invariant.  
They are conditional.

## How L7A Achieves Representation Invariance
L7A’s invariance is not engineered.  
It emerges because fragile representation-specific structures die.

Four mechanisms enforce representation invariance:

### 1. **Multiple traces**
Each trace is a different representation:
- raw price  
- percentage change  
- normalized range  
- differential slope  
- accumulated deviation  

If a pattern only appears in one trace, it dies.

### 2. **Normalization diversity**
Different structures interpret the world through:
- short windows  
- long windows  
- variance-scaled  
- absolute-scaled  

Only structures that survive across these perspectives persist.

### 3. **Population recombination**
Crossover mixes representational components.  
Representation-dependent artifacts cannot survive recombination.

### 4. **Walk-forward purge**
The future eliminates any structure that depends on:
- a specific normalization  
- a specific encoding  
- a specific representation  

The result:  
**the surviving geometry is representationally invariant.**

## Why Representation Invariance Is Required for AGI
Human intelligence is representation-invariant:
- ideas survive translation  
- concepts survive paraphrase  
- meaning survives compression  
- identity survives resolution changes  

Example:  
You know a chair is a chair whether it’s:
- drawn crudely  
- described verbally  
- represented as angles and points  
- seen in silhouette  
- encoded in text  
- viewed from above  

AGI must operate the same way.

Representation invariance is not optional.  
It is foundational to:
- reasoning  
- abstraction  
- truth detection  
- reliable inference  
- hallucination avoidance

## Representation Invariance in Markets
Markets can be represented as:
- raw prices  
- log differences  
- normalized returns  
- detrended streams  
- basket differentials  
- volatility-scaled signals  

L7A finds **the same structure** across all of them because:
- the underlying human behavior is the same  
- the elastic structure is the same  
- the bias topology is the same  

Representation changes; reality does not.

---

## Summary
Representation invariance means:
- real structure survives encoding changes  
- false structure dies under recombination and drift  
- ML systems fail because they depend on representation  
- evolved systems succeed because they eliminate dependence  

This is the twelfth pillar of evolved generalization  
and one of the core requirements for any true AGI architecture.
