# Generalization vs. Interpolation — The Fundamental Divide

## Overview
Machine learning claims to “generalize.”  
It does not.

Machine learning **interpolates** within the manifold of its training data.  
Evolutionary systems **generalize** across drift, novelty, and regime change.

This misunderstanding is one of the core reasons the AI community has hit a wall.

This file explains:
- why interpolation ≠ generalization  
- why generalization requires drift pressure  
- why L7A succeeds out-of-sample  
- why AGI must be evolution-based  

This is the ninth pillar of evolved generalization.

## What Interpolation Really Is
Interpolation means:
- estimating missing points inside a learned region  
- smoothing across examples  
- filling in based on similarity  
- regurgitating learned geometry  
- operating **within** a pre-existing distribution  

Interpolation is:
- bounded  
- limited  
- fundamentally retrospective  
- not robust to novelty  
- not robust to drift  

This is what modern ML systems do.

Even LLMs, in their most advanced forms, are interpolation machines:
- they predict expected continuations  
- not causal explanations  
- and not future truths  

The problem is that interpolation breaks under drift.

## What Generalization Really Is
Generalization means:
- surviving the future  
- detecting invariants that persist across change  
- rejecting noise  
- identifying causal structure  
- producing robust predictions outside known conditions  

Generalization is:
- drift-resistant  
- representation-invariant  
- scale-invariant  
- causal or quasi-causal  
- stable over time  

This is what evolution does — in biology and in L7A.

Generalization requires:
- pressure  
- elimination  
- survival tests  
- drift  
- novelty  
- walk-forward evaluation  

You cannot generalize to the future by fitting the past.

## Why Machine Learning Cannot Generalize
Machine learning lacks:
- death  
- selection  
- drift pressure  
- time-based survival tests  
- population diversity  
- elimination of fragile structure  
- invariance enforcement  

ML systems:
- memorize noise  
- collapse under volatility changes  
- hallucinate under novelty  
- degrade under drift  
- require retraining  
- fail to survive out-of-sample  

Interpolation is not generalization.

Scaling does not fix this.

## Why Evolution Generalizes Naturally
Evolution generalizes because:
- drift destroys false structure  
- noise collapses fragile logic  
- selection amplifies invariants  
- walk-forward survival filters truth  
- novelty is mandatory  
- populations explore representational space  
- complexity collapses into simplicity  

Evolution is tied to time.  
Time is tied to reality.  
Reality enforces truth.

This is the only known process that *automatically* produces generalization.

## Generalization in L7A
L7A survives out-of-sample because:
- fragile bins collapse toward 0.5  
- noisy traces lose influence  
- only persistent imbalances survive  
- complex surfaces are eliminated  
- simple stable geometry remains  
- the system never retrains  
- drift purifies structure  
- population diversity explores invariants  

This is the mechanism behind:
- 20+ years of OOS survival  
- stable predictive behavior  
- non-hallucinatory inference  
- permanent elimination of noise  

L7A does not interpolate.  
It generalizes.

---

## Why This Matters for AGI
An AGI must:
- forecast unseen futures  
- reason about novel states  
- maintain stability under drift  
- operate outside its training manifold  
- avoid hallucinations  
- know when to abstain  
- rely on invariants, not correlations  

No interpolation-based architecture can achieve this.

Generalization requires evolution:
- structure discovery  
- elimination pressure  
- drift testing  
- invariance collapse  
- population diversity  

AGI must be evolved, not trained.

---

## Summary
**Interpolation:**
- fits data  
- memorizes patterns  
- collapses under drift  
- produces brittle intelligence  

**Generalization:**
- extracts real structure  
- survives the future  
- grows simpler over time  
- purifies truth from noise  

Machine learning interpolates.  
Evolution generalizes.

This is the core distinction on which the future of AI depends.
