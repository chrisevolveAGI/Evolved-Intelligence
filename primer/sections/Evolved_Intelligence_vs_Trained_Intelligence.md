# Evolved Intelligence vs. Trained Intelligence — The Defining Contrast

## Overview
Modern AI assumes intelligence comes from:
- training  
- optimization  
- loss minimization  
- scale  
- gradient descent  

This has produced remarkable systems — but not general intelligence.

General intelligence requires:
- elimination  
- simplification  
- invariance discovery  
- stability under drift  
- abstention  
- population diversity  
- negentropy  
- survival  

These properties cannot be trained.  
They must be **evolved**.

This is the thirty-second pillar of evolved generalization.

## The Core Insight
> **Trained systems fit patterns.  
> Evolved systems survive reality.**

Training is retrospective.  
Evolution is prospective.

Training compresses the past.  
Evolution creates structure that endures the future.

This is the defining split between trained intelligence and evolved intelligence.

## What Trained Intelligence Is

### 1. **Interpolation**
Training produces models that operate inside a pre-existing manifold.

### 2. **Correlation tracking**
Deep nets memorize extremely high-dimensional correlations.

### 3. **Representation dependence**
If you change:
- normalization  
- scale  
- tokenization  
- embedding geometry  

the model breaks.

### 4. **Sensitivity to drift**
Trained models fail when distributions change.

### 5. **No deletion mechanism**
False structure accumulates and becomes permanent.

### 6. **Complexity inflation**
More data → more parameters → more fragile geometry.

### 7. **Forced output**
LLMs must produce a token even when they should abstain.

Trained intelligence is **pattern mimicry**, not intelligence.

## What Evolved Intelligence Is

### 1. **Population-based reasoning**
Multiple diverse structures compete in parallel.

### 2. **Elimination of fragile geometry**
Anything that fails under drift dies automatically.

### 3. **Invariant discovery**
Only patterns that survive transformations remain.

### 4. **Abstention**
If a signal is weak → silence.

### 5. **Negentropy**
Evolution creates order by removing disorder.

### 6. **Structure simplification**
Complexity collapses over generations.

### 7. **Truth through survival**
The surviving structure *is* the truth.

Evolved intelligence does not “learn.”  
It **discovers and preserves what is real.**

## L7A as Proof of Evolved Intelligence
L7A demonstrates:
- drift survival  
- representation invariance  
- scale invariance  
- time invariance  
- abstention under uncertainty  
- elimination of false structure  
- emergence of stable geometry  
- non-hallucinatory inference  
- 20+ years of continuous walk-forward survival  

This is not training.  
This is evolution.

## Biological Parallel
Brains are not trained.  
Brains are evolved.

They survive because evolution:
- deletes weak designs  
- preserves strong ones  
- discovers invariants  
- creates abstraction  
- produces negentropy  
- builds multiple diverse populations  
- maintains structure through drift  

Training tweaks parameters.  
Evolution creates intelligence.

## Why AGI Must Be Evolved, Not Trained
AGI requires:
- drift survival  
- stability under novelty  
- cross-domain invariance  
- population diversity  
- real abstention  
- simplification over time  
- calibration  
- elimination of false structure  

These are evolutionary traits.

A trained system cannot achieve them, no matter how large it becomes.

Scaling cannot bridge the gap.  
Evolution can.

## Summary
**Trained Intelligence**
- memorizes  
- interpolates  
- depends on representation  
- collapses under drift  
- hallucinates  
- requires retraining  
- grows more complex over time  

**Evolved Intelligence**
- discards noise  
- survives drift  
- extracts invariants  
- remains calibrated  
- abstains intelligently  
- simplifies over time  
- converges toward truth  

This is the thirty-second pillar of evolved generalization  
and one of the foundational arguments for evolution-based AGI.
