# Evolved Intelligence — Primer Overview
### The Evolutionary Path Toward Generalizing AI

This primer introduces the core principles behind evolved-map architectures such as L7A and L8A. These systems demonstrate how *generalization* can emerge from evolutionary pressure rather than gradient-based training, and how drift-invariant predictive structures can be built from a simple frequentist substrate.

## What This Primer Covers

1. **Why evolution creates true generalization**
2. **Why retraining fails in non-stationary environments**
3. **The frequentist substrate: bins, maps, traces**
4. **The emergence of inference and abstention**
5. **How drift-invariant structures evolve**
6. **How LLMs and modern AI can use these ideas today**
7. **A path toward self-evolving AGI systems**

Each subsequent file in this primer builds one layer of the conceptual stack.

## The Core Insight

Evolution acts as a *continuous filter* across time, eliminating structures that fail to survive future data. This produces **time-invariant**, **drift-resistant**, and **noise-robust** representations.

Unlike neural networks, which mirror the past, evolved systems survive the future.

## Why This Matters for AGI

Modern AI is fragile:
- It hallucinates  
- It miscalibrates  
- It deteriorates under distribution shift  
- It requires endless retraining  
- It lacks self-evaluation and abstention  

An evolved architecture like L7A offers:
- **Natural abstention (zero-signal)**
- **Intrinsic drift detection**
- **Low hallucination risk**
- **Frequentist grounding**
- **True generalization abilities**

This primer shows how to build these systems step-by-step.
