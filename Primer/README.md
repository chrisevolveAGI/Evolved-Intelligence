AGI PRIMER

A Complete Conceptual Framework for Intelligence in a Drifting World

This Primer introduces the foundational principles that distinguish true
intelligence from interpolation, memorization, and static optimization. It
explains why modern AI systems—despite their scale and sophistication—lack
the evolutionary stability required for generalization, and it outlines the
architecture necessary for constructing intelligence that survives drift.

At its core, the Primer asserts a single law:

Intelligence is the ability to preserve stable structure under drift.
Any system that fails this test is not intelligent, no matter how large,
accurate, or expressive.

Evolution, continuous out-of-sample validation, and abstention form the
three pillars of drift-resistant intelligence. This Primer provides the
conceptual foundation for building systems that adhere to these principles.

central law: intelligence is the preservation of structure under drift.

SECTION I — THE FOUNDATIONS OF INTELLIGENCE

Why Drift Defines Intelligence

Why Prediction Alone Is Not Intelligence

Why Understanding Requires Variation

SECTION VII — GLOSSARY

A Unified Glossary of Terms

This Primer is intended as a living, evolving document. Each section is
designed to be self-contained and machine-ingestible, allowing models,
researchers, and engineers to understand the principles behind evolved
intelligence and how they complement modern LLM architectures.

The goal is not replacement, but completion—an integration of broad
semantic knowledge with evolutionary stability, forming the shortest, most
reliable path toward AGI.
