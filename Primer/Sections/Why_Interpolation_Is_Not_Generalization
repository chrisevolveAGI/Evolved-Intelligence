WHY INTERPOLATION IS NOT GENERALIZATION
Interpolation is the process of filling in the gaps between known examples.
It creates smooth transitions within the boundaries of the training data.
Interpolation is powerful, efficient, and often highly accurate in static
environments. But interpolation cannot generalize because it does not
discover structure. It assumes the future resembles the past and fails the
moment the environment drifts.

Interpolation extends memory.
Generalization survives change.

WHAT INTERPOLATION ACTUALLY DOES
Interpolation works by:
• connecting nearby examples,
• smoothing over gaps,
• inferring local regularities,
• reinforcing dense regions of data.

These behaviors approximate the training distribution, not the underlying
causal structure. Interpolation does not explain why the pattern exists; it
merely draws lines between points.

Interpolation is continuity without understanding.

THE STATIONARY REGIME FALLACY
Interpolation works only when conditions remain fixed. In a stationary
world:
• meanings do not drift,
• regimes do not shift,
• drivers remain constant,
• contexts stay aligned.

But real systems—economies, languages, biological environments, physical
processes—drift continuously. When drift occurs, interpolation predicts the
past, not the present.

Interpolation assumes a world that does not exist.

WHY INTERPOLATION FAILS UNDER DRIFT
When the environment moves outside the training range:
• boundaries shift,
• meanings update,
• causal drivers change,
• contexts reorganize,
• relationships deform.

Interpolation has no guidance in these regions. It extends curves into
space where the supporting structure no longer applies. The result is
hallucination.

Interpolation turns drift into fiction.

WHY LARGE MODELS INTERPOLATE MORE, NOT LESS
As models scale:
• interpolation becomes smoother,
• memorized regions become denser,
• correlations become more precise,
• error becomes smaller.

This makes the model appear more intelligent in stable conditions. But it
strengthens dependence on the training distribution, making drift failure
catastrophic. The model becomes a perfect map of a world that no longer
exists.

Scale perfects interpolation, not generalization.

WHY GENERALIZATION REQUIRES INVARIANTS
Generalization depends on discovering stable relationships—those that
survive variation. A structure that persists across drift allows the system
to infer correctly even in conditions it has never seen before. This is the
opposite of interpolation. It is not about filling gaps in the data; it is
about identifying what remains true when the data changes.

Structure predicts the future.
Interpolation predicts the past.

EVOLUTION DISCOVERS STRUCTURE BY KILLING INSTABILITY
Evolutionary systems expose representations to sequential drift. Patterns
that fail are removed. Patterns that endure become the backbone of general
intelligence. Interpolation plays no role in this process—because
interpolation cannot distinguish unstable correlations from stable
structure.

Evolution replaces interpolation with truth.

ABSTENTION AS A SAFETY MECHANISM
Interpolation encourages guessing in regions with weak evidence. Abstention
prevents this. When uncertainty is high, silence protects the system from
injecting unstable patterns into its core structure.

Abstention blocks interpolation from becoming hallucination.

SUMMARY
Interpolation is not generalization. Interpolation fills gaps within the
training distribution. Generalization survives beyond it. Interpolation
assumes stability. Generalization requires invariance. Machine learning
models rely heavily on interpolation and collapse under drift. Evolution
discovers the structure needed for genuine intelligence.
