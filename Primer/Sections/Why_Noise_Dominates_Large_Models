WHY NOISE DOMINATES LARGE MODELS
As models grow, they absorb more data, more correlations, and more apparent
patterns. But scale does not make these patterns more stable. It simply
increases the amount of noise the system can memorize. Because noise is
more abundant than structure in any real dataset, large models inevitably
encode far more noise than truth. When the environment drifts, this noise
collapses, producing overconfidence, hallucination, and structural failure.

Scale increases capacity, not stability.
Noise grows faster than truth.

THE COMBINATORIAL EXPLOSION OF NOISE
In any real-world domain:
• stable structure is sparse,
• unstable correlations are abundant,
• regime-specific patterns dominate the data,
• temporary alignments far outnumber invariants.

As model capacity increases, the number of unstable correlations it can
internalize expands combinatorially. The model becomes filled with patterns
that will not survive drift.

Large models memorize noise at scale.

WHY BIGGER MODELS LOOK SMARTER—AT FIRST
With more parameters, a model can:
• reduce loss more effectively,
• interpolate with higher fidelity,
• mimic examples more closely,
• fit complex surface-level correlations.

This improves in-sample performance, giving the appearance of
understanding. But this improvement is entirely dependent on the stability
of the training window. Under drift, the advantage disappears.

Scale amplifies mimicry, not understanding.

DRIFT EXPOSES NOISE
When the environment moves:
• noise collapses instantly,
• unstable correlations flip signs,
• confidence remains high,
• outputs become incoherent,
• hallucination increases.

The sheer volume of noise encoded in large models guarantees widespread
failure under drift.

The bigger the model, the bigger the collapse.

WHY OPTIMIZATION CANNOT DISTINGUISH NOISE
Loss-based training rewards every pattern that reduces error. It does not
care whether the pattern:
• is stable,
• is fragile,
• is causal,
• will survive drift.

Optimization strengthens noise as aggressively as it strengthens structure.
This creates a dense internal geometry dominated by unstable correlations.

Optimization perfects instability.

MORE DATA MAKES IT WORSE
Adding more data does not increase the fraction of stable
relationships. It increases:
• noise density,
• regime artifacts,
• short-lived correlations,
• semantic drift residues,
• measurement bias,
• transient alignment patterns.

Large datasets overwhelm the tiny portion of the signal that actually
survives variation.

More data reinforces noise at scale.

EVOLUTION FILTERS NOISE BY EXPOSING IT TO DRIFT
Evolutionary systems eliminate unstable patterns through survival tests.
Every representation must function across sequential out-of-sample drift.
Patterns that fail are removed. Patterns that endure are reinforced. Over
time, the system accumulates only stable structure and sheds noise
naturally.

Evolution filters noise.
Scaling memorizes it.

ABSTENTION CONTAINS NOISE BEFORE IT SPREADS
Forced prediction reinforces unstable correlations. Abstention prevents the
model from learning from weak evidence. Silence stops noise from entering
the structural core and preserves the integrity of the representation.

Abstention prevents noise infection.

SUMMARY
Large models memorize more noise than truth because unstable correlations
vastly outnumber stable structure. Optimization amplifies this noise,
making models appear intelligent in stationary settings but fragile under
drift. More data makes the problem worse, not better. Only evolutionary
pressure, drift testing, and abstention can suppress noise and reveal the
stable structures required for real intelligence.
