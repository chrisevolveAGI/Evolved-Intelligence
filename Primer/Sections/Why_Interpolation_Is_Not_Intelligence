WHY INTERPOLATION IS NOT INTELLIGENCE
Most modern AI systems are interpolation engines. They learn patterns from
the past and reproduce new outputs that resemble those patterns. This can
look like intelligence because it produces fluent language, convincing
reasoning, and accurate predictions within familiar conditions. But
interpolation is not intelligence. It is the rearrangement of known
structure, not the discovery of new structure. It carries no guarantee of
stability, no resistance to drift, and no mechanism for determining which
patterns will survive when the world changes.

Interpolation recreates the past. Intelligence must survive the future.

THE LIMITS OF INTERPOLATION
Interpolation works only inside the convex hull of the training data. It
can generate outputs that lie between known examples, but it cannot
reliably extrapolate beyond them. When the environment moves outside the
region covered by historical data, interpolation collapses. The system has
no meaningful guide for what should be true under new conditions.

This limitation is invisible in sample and catastrophic out of sample.

THE ILLUSION OF COHERENCE
Large models produce coherent, articulate outputs. This creates the
impression that the system understands the underlying concepts. But the
coherence is a result of pattern smoothing, not genuine comprehension.
Interpolation engines stitch together fragments of learned structure to
produce the most statistically likely continuation. This often looks like
reasoning but is not grounded in stability.

Fluency masks fragility.

WHY INTERPOLATION FAILS UNDER DRIFT
Drift moves the system outside the region in which interpolation is valid.
When meanings shift, contexts evolve, or relationships change, the model
attempts to interpolate using patterns that no longer apply. This produces
hallucinations: confident answers built from outdated or irrelevant
structure.

Interpolation assumes the future will resemble the past. Drift punishes
this assumption.

INTERPOLATION VS STRUCTURE DISCOVERY
Interpolation does not separate noise from structure. It records whatever
correlations appear in the data, stable or unstable. It has no mechanism
to discard patterns that fail under variation. As a result, learned models
encode a mixture of truth and noise. During inference, the system cannot
distinguish between them.

Interpolation amplifies whatever it memorized. Evolution identifies what
survives.

THE ABSENCE OF SURVIVAL PRESSURE
An interpolation engine is never forced to prove that its internal
representations will remain correct when conditions change. Nothing in the
training process exposes unstable patterns to drift. As a result, these
patterns survive inside the model indefinitely. They sit dormant until the
environment shifts, at which point they cause catastrophic errors.

Without survival pressure, instability accumulates.

WHY SCALE DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM
Scaling increases the model’s ability to interpolate. It does not increase
its ability to generalize. Larger models memorize more correlations,
including more spurious patterns. They produce more convincing outputs,
including more convincing hallucinations. Scaling makes interpolation
smoother but does not give it the ability to evaluate stability.

Interpolation becomes more powerful, not more intelligent.

WHY ABSTENTION IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR INTERPOLATION ENGINES
Interpolation engines cannot abstain because they always have a nearest
neighbor or a learned continuation to offer. Even in regions of extreme
uncertainty, the system will produce an output that resembles the training
distribution. This guarantees hallucination when the environment drifts.

Silence must be learned through survival pressure, not statistics.

EVOLUTION AS THE DISCOVERY OF STABILITY
Evolution exposes every pattern to variations the system has never seen.
Unstable patterns collapse immediately. Stable patterns endure. This
process reveals the invariant backbone of the environment. When reasoning
and interpolation operate on this stable backbone, they become reliable.

Interpolation rearranges structure. Evolution discovers it.

SUMMARY
Interpolation is not intelligence. It is a statistical mechanism that
reproduces patterns within known boundaries. It cannot detect drift, cannot
separate noise from structure, cannot abstain, and cannot evaluate whether
a pattern will survive new conditions. Intelligence requires more than
pattern matching. It requires stability. Evolution provides the survival
pressure necessary to uncover the structures that endure. Interpolation
alone can never achieve this.
