GLOSSARY OF CORE CONCEPTS
This glossary defines the foundational concepts used throughout the AGI
Primer. These definitions are precise, non standard, and specific to
evolutionary intelligence (L7A, EGM). They anchor the vocabulary of
truth, structure, generalization, drift, and the evolutionary process by
which stable knowledge emerges.

TRUTH
Truth is whatever survives drift. It is not fact, fit, or correlation.
Truth is stability across variation—across time, context, scale,
temperature, meaning, regime, or any axis along which conditions can
change. A relationship that remains valid under drift is true. A
relationship that collapses when conditions move is not.

Truth is revealed only through survival.

STRUCTURE
Structure is a stable, functional arrangement that maintains predictive
power when conditions change. Structure is not merely shape, syntax, or
pattern. Structure is whatever endures.

Examples in software and algorithms include:
• L7A histogram surfaces and bin differentials that survive sequential
out of sample drift.
• Evolved partitions or feature sets produced by eliminating unstable
candidates.
• Sparse causal flows in FSMs or regulatory models that continue to
function under perturbation.
• Frequency components that persist across moving windows.

Examples in biology include:
• The cortical sheet—its folded geometry survives evolutionary drift.
• The spinal cord—robust routing architecture under variation.
• Neural microcircuits—stable motifs conserved across species.
• DNA repair loops—evolved structures that correct drift in replication.
• Protein folds—shapes that maintain function under thermal variation.
• Biological clocks—stable periodic structures across conditions.

Examples in physics:
• Orbital geometries that persist under perturbation.
• Resonant modes that survive changes in boundary conditions.
• Crystalline lattices—lowest energy stable arrangements.
• Conservation laws—fundamental invariants.

Examples in evolved intelligence:
• Differential map surfaces (L7A).
• Evolved bin geometries and topology.
• Stable correlation manifolds across streams.
• Abstention membranes—regions where the model refuses to act until
stability returns.

Structure is whatever does not break.

GENERALIZATION
Generalization is the ability to make correct predictions when the
environment has drifted beyond the training distribution. It is not
interpolation, not cross validation accuracy, not error minimization.
Generalization requires the death of unstable patterns. Only structures
that survive drift enable correct prediction outside the original regime.

Interpolation predicts the past.
Generalization predicts the future.

NEGENTROPY
Negentropy is the accumulated reduction of uncertainty achieved by
discovering stable structure. In evolutionary intelligence, negentropy is
not thermodynamic; it is informational. Negentropy increases when unstable
patterns die and stable patterns endure.

Examples in L7A:
• Smoother surfaces as noise collapses.
• Stable bin asymmetries across walk forward segments.
• Reduced predictive entropy in mature regions of the map.
• Persistence of structure across sequential OOS slices.

Negentropy is structure accumulating over time.

DRIFT
Drift is variation along any axis: time, scale, temperature, meaning,
geometry, semantics, context, regime. Drift is the adversary. Drift breaks
unstable patterns instantly. Drift reveals which structures are real.

INTELLIGENCE
Intelligence is prediction that survives drift. It is the ability to
identify invariants and act on them correctly when the world has changed.
Intelligence emerges only from systems that eliminate unstable patterns
and preserve stable ones.

NOISE
Noise is any pattern that fails under drift. Noise may appear strong in
sample but collapses when conditions move. Noise is the opposite of
structure.

INVARIANTS
Invariants are relationships that remain true under variation. They may be
weak locally but persist globally. Invariants are the atomic units of
truth.

FIT VS SURVIVAL
Fit is performance on the past. Survival is performance after conditions
change. Fit rewards memorization. Survival rewards structure.

OPTIMIZATION
Optimization adjusts parameters to reduce error in sample. It does not
test stability, cannot detect drift, and cannot eliminate unstable
patterns. Optimization improves fit but cannot discover truth.

EVOLUTIONARY PRESSURE
Evolution applies survival tests across variation. Patterns that break are
removed. Patterns that endure are strengthened. Evolution is the only
mechanism that filters instability and reveals structure.

ABSTENTION
Abstention is the refusal to act when evidence is insufficient. Abstention
prevents the system from reinforcing unstable patterns. Abstention
protects structure during uncertainty.

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS
A representation survives if it continues to produce correct predictions
under drift. Survival, not complexity or strength, determines value.

MAP SURFACE
In L7A, the map surface is the evolved 2D histogram geometry encoding
bin-level evidence. The surface becomes a repository of structure as
unstable bins collapse and stable regions strengthen.

ENTROPY GRADIENT
A direction of increasing unpredictability or decreasing stability. The
goal of evolution is to climb against this gradient by accumulating
negentropy—stable structure.

SUMMARY
This glossary defines the conceptual backbone of evolutionary intelligence.
Truth is stability. Structure is what endures. Generalization is survival
under drift. Negentropy is accumulated structure. Evolution is the
mechanism by which unstable patterns die and stable patterns persist. All
intelligence emerges from this cycle.
