PREDICTION UNDER DRIFT IS INTELLIGENCE
Prediction is often treated as a measure of intelligence, but this is true
only in environments that change. In a stationary world, prediction is
easy. Even simple models can achieve high accuracy by memorizing the past,
interpolating between examples, or compressing correlations that never
move. This creates the illusion of intelligence without requiring any real
understanding.

But in a drifting or non stationary environment, prediction becomes the
most demanding test of all. When the underlying relationships shift across
time, context, scale, or any other axis of variation, only systems that
have discovered the stable structures can continue to predict correctly.
This is the boundary where prediction becomes indistinguishable from
understanding. In drifting environments, prediction is intelligence.

THE FALLACY OF STATIONARY PREDICTION
Stationary environments reward memory, not insight. A system can perform
extremely well simply by storing correlations that remain unchanged. No
mechanism is required to distinguish structure from noise. No temporal or
contextual tests challenge the model’s assumptions. As long as conditions
remain fixed, even fragile models appear strong.

Stationary prediction mimics intelligence without achieving it.

WHY DRIFT CHANGES EVERYTHING
Drift exposes the instability of learned correlations. When meanings
change, regimes shift, or underlying conditions move, unstable patterns
collapse instantly. A system that relied on these patterns reveals that it
never understood the domain. It was fitting curves, not discovering
structure.

Drift forces the system to identify what is truly stable.

PREDICTION AS A TEST OF INVARIANTS
In drifting environments, prediction requires the system to locate the
invariants the relationships that remain true even when everything else
changes. These invariants may be weak in the short term, subtle, or easy
to overlook, but they survive variation. Correct prediction under drift is
evidence that the system has discovered these stable structures.

Prediction becomes a test of endurance, not correlation.

WHY INTERPOLATION FAILS UNDER DRIFT
Interpolation relies on the assumption that the future lies between the
examples seen in the past. Drift violates this assumption. When the target
moves outside the region covered by the training data, interpolation
produces confident but incorrect outputs. The model has no guidance
because it never learned the true structure—only its appearance.

Interpolation predicts the past. Intelligence predicts the future.

EVOLUTION AS THE DISCOVERY MECHANISM
Only evolutionary systems test each representation against drift. Patterns
that fail under variation are removed. Patterns that survive become part
of the stable backbone. This process transforms prediction into a measure
of structural truth. When predictions remain accurate after the world has
changed, the system has identified real invariants.

Evolution turns prediction into understanding.

THE ROLE OF ABSTENTION
During periods of rapid drift, even stable structures may be temporarily
obscured. A system that is forced to guess will hallucinate. A system that
can abstain will wait for clarity. This protects the underlying
representation from contamination and maintains predictive stability over
time.

Silence is a survival strategy when the world is shifting.

WHY THIS DEFINES INTELLIGENCE
In a drifting world, intelligence is the ability to make correct
predictions when the training distribution no longer applies. This
requires discovering what persists, rejecting what breaks, and grounding
all inferences in structures that survive variation. Prediction becomes
evidence of understanding only when the environment moves.

Intelligence is prediction that survives drift.

SUMMARY
Prediction in stationary systems is not intelligence; it is interpolation.
Prediction in drifting systems is intelligence, because it requires the
discovery of stable structure. Drift exposes the difference between
memorization and understanding. Evolution uncovers invariants that persist
under variation. Abstention protects the model during uncertainty. When a
system can predict correctly after the world has changed, it has achieved
something that mirrors the core of intelligence itself.
