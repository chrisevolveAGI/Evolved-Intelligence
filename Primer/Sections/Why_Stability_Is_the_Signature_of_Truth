WHY STABILITY IS THE SIGNATURE OF TRUTH
In any drifting or variational system, the only reliable indicator of truth
is stability. A pattern that remains consistent across changing conditions
is far more likely to reflect underlying structure than one that holds only
within a narrow regime. Stability under variation is what distinguishes
deep, causal relationships from shallow, temporary correlations. Truth is
revealed not by fit, but by endurance.

Truth is what remains when everything else changes.

WHY FIT IS NOT A MEASURE OF TRUTH
A model may achieve:
• low error,
• high accuracy,
• smooth interpolation,
• excellent in-sample metrics.

But none of these demonstrate truth. They demonstrate compatibility with a
specific regime. Fit measures how well a representation matches the past.
Truth measures how well it survives the future.

Fit measures alignment.
Truth measures resilience.

WHY STABILITY REVEALS UNDERLYING STRUCTURE
If a relationship persists across:
• drift,
• noise,
• context changes,
• regime shifts,
• perturbations,
• unseen conditions,

it is unlikely to be accidental. Stability is the fingerprint of a
structural invariant. Only deep structure maintains coherence across
variation.

Instability exposes correlation.
Stability exposes causality.

WHY UNSTABLE RELATIONSHIPS CAN LOOK STRONG
Temporary correlations often have:
• impressive statistical strength,
• clear visual patterns,
• high predictive value—temporarily,
• apparent causal interpretations.

But when drift appears, these relationships collapse instantly. Their
instability reveals that their previous coherence was an accident of the
training environment.

Unstable truth is not truth.

WHY SCALE MAKES INSTABILITY WORSE
Larger models absorb more patterns—stable and unstable alike. Because
unstable correlations vastly outnumber truly invariant structure, scaling
increases the volume of fragile patterns. These patterns appear strong in
stable conditions but collapse under drift.

Scale increases the mass of instability.
Evolution decreases it.

EVOLUTION USES STABILITY AS THE FITNESS TEST
Evolutionary systems continuously expose representations to new
out-of-sample conditions. Representations that fail are eliminated.
Representations that remain stable are reinforced. Stability becomes the
selection pressure that shapes the model’s structure.

Evolution does not search for truth.
It filters for stability—and truth emerges.

ABSTENTION MAINTAINS STABILITY IN UNCERTAIN REGIMES
During rapid drift, ambiguous signals appear. Forced prediction in these
regions reinforces unstable correlations. Abstention protects the system by
avoiding commitments to patterns that lack demonstrated stability.

Abstention keeps instability from becoming structure.

SUMMARY
Stability, not fit, is the signature of truth. Fit reflects the past.
Truth survives the future. Only patterns that remain coherent under drift
and variation represent deep structure. Evolution filters instability,
accumulating stable invariants. Abstention preserves this structure during
uncertainty. Truth is what remains when variation has stripped everything
else away.
