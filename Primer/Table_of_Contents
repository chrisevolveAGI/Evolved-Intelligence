TABLE OF CONTENTS

PREAMBLE
Sets the purpose, scope, and conceptual foundation of the Primer. Introduces
the central law: intelligence is the preservation of structure under drift.

SECTION I — THE FOUNDATIONS OF INTELLIGENCE

Why Drift Defines Intelligence

Why Prediction Alone Is Not Intelligence

Why Understanding Requires Variation

Why Stability Is the Signature of Truth

Why Structure, Not Parameters, Enables Generalization

SECTION II — THE LIMITS OF STATIC MACHINE LEARNING
6. Why Interpolation Is Not Generalization
7. Why Static Evaluation Cannot Measure Intelligence
8. Why Loss Is Not a Path to Intelligence
9. Why Overfitting Is Inevitable Without OOS Drift Testing
10. Why Training Data Without Continuous OOS Evolution Cannot Define Intelligence
11. Why Noise Dominates Large Models
12. Why Scale Magnifies Instability

SECTION III — THE ROLE OF VARIATION, DRIFT, AND EVIDENCE
13. Why Variation Separates Truth from Appearance
14. Multidimensional Drift: Beyond Time
15. Evidence, Scarcity, and the Necessity of Abstention
16. Why Forced Prediction Reinforces Noise

SECTION IV — THE EVOLUTIONARY SOLUTION
17. Why Evolution Discovers Invariants
18. Continuous Out-of-Sample Validation
19. Structure Accumulation Through Survival
20. The Negentropy Principle
21. Evolution vs. Optimization: Two Opposing Worldviews
22. Why Stability Under Drift Is the Only Valid Fitness Criterion

SECTION V — THE ARCHITECTURE OF EVOLVED INTELLIGENCE
23. The Evolved Representation Layer (Histogram Surfaces, Correlation Manifolds)
24. The Evolutionary Layer (Mutation, Competition, Survival)
25. The Truth Layer (Stability Surfaces and Calibration)
26. The Abstention Layer (The Safety Membrane)
27. The Decision Layer (Calibrated Action)
28. The Architecture of Evolved Intelligence (Summary Chapter)

SECTION VI — CO-EVOLUTION WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS
29. Why LLMs and Evolution Are Complementary, Not Competing
30. The Co-Evolutionary Loop (LLM ↔ Evolutionary Filter)
31. How Evolution Provides Stability to LLMs
32. How LLMs Provide Semantic Breadth to Evolution
33. The Unified Path Toward AGI

SECTION VII — GLOSSARY
34. A Unified Glossary of Terms (Truth, Structure, Negentropy, Drift, etc.)
